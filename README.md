# Simple-Linear-Regression

- Developed simple python program that implements Linear Regression on a sample dataset.
- The object of the class is declared and is fitted with the X_Train and Y_Train data.
- A graph is plotted using the matplotlib.pyplot to visually represent the Linear Regression model.
- The programuses sklearn.linear_model from the scikit-learn library to import the class LinearRegression.
- Y_Pred stores the predicted values of X_Test
